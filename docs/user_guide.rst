    SparcleQC depends on a properly formatted PDB file. Make sure your PDB follows the standard format. SparcleQC does not require occupancy, temperature factor, segment identifier, or formal charge, but it does require all other columns. 

    **CHARMM vs Amber**

    If using CHARMM, add the protein PDB's path under the :python:`pdb_file` keyword. A psf file (downloaded from CHARMM-GUI) should be in your working directory with the same name as the protein's PDB but with the .psf extension. Separately add the ligand named "ligand.pdb" to your working directory. Futhermore, the path to the toplogy and parameter files for the chosen CHARMM forcefield should be specified using the keywords :python:`charmm_rtf` and :python:`charmm_prm` respectively.

    If using Amber, the :python:`pdb_file` path must point to a PDB with the complex (both the protein and ligand included).

    **On capping terminal residues**

    For CHARMM, capping of the terminal residues can be done through CHARMM-GUI before running SparcleQC. However, when using an Amber Forcefield, users have the option to have SparcleQC cap the terminal residues with ACE and NME where appropriate. If uploading a PDB with terminal residues already capped with NME and ACE, the following atom names should be used in columns 13-16: hydrogens in NME and ACE should be named H1, H2, and H, the carbon in NME should be named C. Additionally, the peptidic hydrogen (on the backbone nitrogen) of the terminal residues should be named H, not H1. In the SparcleQC input file, set :python:`pre-capped: true`. 

    If uploading a PDB without endcaps on terminal residues, SparcleQC will automatically handle the tasks above.

.. dropdown:: Cutting and Capping Bonds
    
    Alpha carbon - carbonyl carbon bonds are cut to separate the QM region from the MM region.

        :class: only-dark
        :align: center
        :width: 500 px

    The valencies on the QM atoms of the cut bonds are satisfied by placing a hydrogen along the cut bond. The hydrogen bond length, :math:`r_{\rm{Q1-H1}}`, is determined by

    .. math::
    
        r_{\rm{Q1-H1}} = r_{\rm{Q1-M1}}\frac{r^{\rm{QM0}}_{\rm{Q1-HL}}}{r^{\rm{MM0}}_{\rm{Q1-M1}}},
    
    where :math:`r_{\rm{Q1-M1}}` is the bond length of the cut bond, :math:`r^{\rm{QM0}}_{\rm{Q1-M1}}` is the corresponding bond length according to the force field used, and :math:`r^{\rm{QM0}}_{\rm{Q1-HL}}` is the force field bond length for the hydrogen link bond. [1]_

.. dropdown:: QM/MM Boundary Charges

    Point charges too close to the capped QM region may cause overpolarization. Users have the option of choosing one of nine charge schemes to alter charges at this boundary. These schemes are:

    * **Z1**: Charges of the M1 atoms are set to zero.
    * **Z2**: Charges of the M1 and M2 atoms are set to zero.
    * **Z3**: Charges of the M1, M2, and M3 atoms are set to zero.
    * **DZ1**: At each cut, the charge of M1 is set to zero, and the charge needed to return the MM boundary residue to its original integer charge is evenly distributed to all MM atoms in that residue.
    * **DZ2**: At each cut, the charges of M1 and M2 atoms are set to zero, and the charge needed to return the MM boundary residue to its original integer charge is evenly distributed to all MM atoms in that residue.
    * **DZ3**: At each cut, the charges of M1, M2, and M3 atoms are set to zero, and the charge needed to return the MM boundary residue to its original integer charge is evenly distributed to all MM atoms in that residue.
    * **BRC**: At each cut, the charge of M1 is set to zero, and the charge needed to return the MM boundary residue to its original integer charge is evenly distributed to the midpoints of the M1-M2 bonds.
    * **BRCD**: At each cut, the charge of M1 is set to zero, and the charge needed to return the MM boundary residue to its original integer charge is evenly distributed to the midpoints of the M1-M2 bonds, but doubled. This charge is also subtracted from each M2 atom within the residue.
    * **BRC2**: At each cut, the charge of M1 is set to zero, and the charge needed to return the MM boundary residue to its original integer charge is evenly distributed to the M2 atoms in that residue.

    For SAPT0 in Psi4, we recommend BRC. [2]_

.. dropdown:: Templating a QM Region for Congeneric Ligands

    Studies that compare a protein with two similar ligand structures may choose to equilibrate protein structures for each ligand. In this case, the two PDBs may be similar in structure, but not identical, and their coordinates likely will not match. Here, we show the steps of (1) creating a SAPT input file for one ligand (named methyl), then (2) using the QM region of 'methyl' as a template for cutting the QM region of the other ligand, named 'chlorine'.


    Step 1, the following is 'methyl.in':

    .. code-block::

        pdb_file: 2cji_methyl.pdb
        pre-capped: true
        cutoff: 5
        seed: ligand
        charge_scheme: BRC
        ligand_charge: 0
        method: fisapt0
        basis_set: aug-cc-pv(D+d)z
        amber_ff: ff19SB
        water_model: opc
        o_charge: 0
        h_charge: 0.6791
        ep_charge: -1.3582
        software: psi4
        mem: 60 GB
        nthreads: 10
 
       
    Step 2, the following is 'chlorine.in':

    .. code-block::

        pdb_file: 2cji_chlorine.pdb
        pre-capped: true
        template_path: methyl/cx_autocap_fixed.pdb
        charge_scheme: BRC
        ligand_charge: 0
        method: fisapt0
        basis_set: aug-cc-pv(D+d)z
        amber_ff: ff19SB
        water_model: opc
        o_charge: 0
        h_charge: 0.6791
        ep_charge: -1.3582
        software: psi4
        mem: 60 GB
        nthreads: 10
  
    With the two SAPT files, a relative interaction energy can be computed, giving insight into which ligand is more stable within the protein pocket. 
      
.. dropdown:: Convergence Study with Increasing QM Region Size via API

    A Python loop can be used to generate multiple input files with an increasing size of the QM region. We can increase the size of the QM region by incrementing the cutoff. An example Python script is below.    

    .. code-block::
 
        import sparcleqc

	inputs = {
            'pdb_file': '2cji.pdb',
            'pre-capped': 'True',
            'seed': 'ligand',
            'charge_scheme': 'BRC',
            'ligand_charge': 0,
            'method': 'fisapt0',
            'basis_set': 'aug-cc-pv(D+d)z',
            'amber_ff': 'ff19SB',
            'water_model': 'opc' ,
            'o_charge': 0,
            'h_charge': 0.6791,
            'ep_charge': -1.3582,
            'software': 'psi4',
            'mem': '60 GB',
            'nthreads': 10}

	cutoffs = [3, 4, 5]

	for c in cutoffs:
	    inputs['cutoff'] = f'{c}'
	    inputs['input_filename'] = f'cutoff_{c}.in'
	    print(inputs)
	    sparcleqc.run_sparcle(user_options = inputs)
